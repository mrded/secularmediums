You are welcome to select from the following Four Types of Session:
<h3><strong>INTENSIVE ONE HOUR WHOLE-LIFE-ANALYSIS:</strong> This Session
           begins at the beginning, and goes right to the end of the life.
           Depth analysis of your key issues. I focus on the client's
           potential  and its development into the future. And, compare where
           you are now with where you can be according to your needs, goals,
           aspirations. Then I guide you to the smoothest path toward the
           evolution of your personal choices.
           <strong>HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS:</strong> I test your 'What if ..'
           alternative paths to see if you're on the best one. Ask all your
           questions as I watch what happens to you on those paths.
           <strong>OTHER MINDS</strong> clarifies what they want you to
           know and why. <strong>THE RETROSPECTIVE</strong> Drawing forward
your own <strong>Elder Self</strong> - who you will be in the last ten to fifteen year stage of your life. Visiioning your last Self, I can tell you your own late-life assessment of entire your life. Ask your Elder Self any question, I will transfer that information to you. As in all Sessions, where relevant,
I penetrate subconscious levels to access the deeper meanings, intentions, potentials of you or any relevant other. Career. Relationship Paths/Options. Key Points. Clairvoyant Diagnosis. Tape included.
</h3><h3><strong>HALF HOUR CHECK-UP:</strong> focuses on core issues. Ask your most
           important questions of life, of yourself, of others. I will draw the
           answers from the universe; from those who want to guide you; and
           from your own energy field, which contains all information. Like a
           Check-Up at the doctor's, when you have several significant points
           to make but feel generally ok.
</h3><h3><strong>TELEPHONE READING:</strong> These Sessions are wonderful. As I am
           free from physical proximity to the client, my mind ranges quickly
           over their needs and questions. The client: 1) Prepares their key
           questions, omitting all background information. 2) Selects either an
           hour or a half hour session; 3) Selects a mutually convenient time
           for the Session. 4) Sends me their check. 5) Calls me at the
           appointed time.  As with all Sessions, I sit in meditation about
           ten minutes before the client is due to call, during which I will
           have picked up their key issues. When the call arrives, I go
           straight into the Session without any formalities. I tape the
           Session, and mail this to the client.
</h3><h3><strong>EMAIL READING:</strong> Over the years, many clients have
           requested Email Readings. When I am in America, European clients may
           want a Session. When I am in Europe, Americans want a Session.
           Initially, I hesitated, because I thought that clients might be
           short-changed by not having the experience of questioning me
           directly. However, after much persuasion from clients, I decided to
           offer Email Readings and found them to be exceedingly valuable.
           The client: 1) Emails their key questions, omitting any background
           information. 2) Selects an Hour or a Half Hour Session. 3) Sends
           me their check. I sit in meditation on the Questions, according to
           the Session selected, and type the answer(s) (and much more) on to
           single-spaced A4 pages. Normally, a One Hour Session provides ten to
           fifteen pages. A Half Hour, about five pages. I either email the
           pages or mail the hard copy to the client, as requested.
