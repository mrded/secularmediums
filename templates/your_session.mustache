<h1>Your Session</h1>

<p>
  While I see everything every medium does, I interpret it very differently. Instead of 'spirits' and 'ghosts', I work in terms of energy fields and frequencies.

<h4>Comprehensive Whole-Life Analysis</h4>
Sessions are intense, and as unique as the client, they enable the client to:

<ul>
  <li>Understand own strengths, weaknesses, motives, needs, potentials, and those of significant others whether they are prior to conception/birth, alive, or deceased.</li>
  <li>
    Assess & utilize information from significant others wherever they vibrate.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PAST VISIONING:</strong> explores the effects past issues have on client's present self-image, events, attitudes, and so on. AIM: SELF-KNOWLEDGE.</li>
      <li><strong>PRESENT VISIONING:</strong> depth-analysis at both conscious-subliminal levels for client and significant others regarding needs, motives, intentions. AIM: SELF-DEVELOPMENT.</li>
      <li><strong>FUTURE VISIONING:</strong> explores coming opportunities/obstacles; specifies best ways to actualize client potential through future choices. AIM: SELF-EMPOWERMENT.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enables the client to: Plan positively for the future in the light of new knowledge. Know in advance when and how changes will be possible/beneficial for self and others.</li>
</ul>

  <strong>YOUR GUARANTEE:</strong> I always tell my clients that if the medium does not know everything without being told, don't pay her/him. And you do not pay me if you are not completely satisfied with your reading.
