<strong>THE CARLIA NOTES<strong><br> Note and Excerpt: Carlia was an Italian student who came to live with us for a time in Edinburgh. A confirmed Marxist, she thought all mediums were frauds because the future could not be known, and so on. A very materialist perspective. However, one evening, in shock, she asked me to contact her lover who had died as she felt him near. Carlia had never told me what happened to him, only that he had died and that she had had to leave Italy for the pain of it.
<br>I instantly mirrored the man, became him. My head was smashed by the car that killed him. I hovered over his dying body as he lay in the corridor of the emergency room. This was the first time I saw what he looked like. As he moved from rage at this state to full acceptance, we travelled together through the various Gates Of The Next Consciousness. We travelled from this frequency to that of complete permeation of the next. I name it The Mothering Universe in the following quote:
<br>'Then, suddenly satiating my need, the atmosphere thickened,
         swelled into sweet nourishing substance which breathed me,
         fed me, watered me! The world had become food and I fed
         at its sweet breast.
<br> The world switched functions again. Translucent waves of meaning
         splashed over me when I saw clearly for the first time. I saw that
         while the world breathed me, I breathed it back. That as the world
         fed me, I fed it back. I saw that by some glorious reciprocity,
         circles are real. Silence befell me then. And, I slept'.
<br>The next frequencies or dimensions we passed through I named:
Entry Into The Next Frequency. The Universal Mother Template. Immortal Androgyne (This is extraordinary. The consciousnesses or energy patterns that came to meet and guide him on are more subtle and sublime than we have words for). Last Visions. Parting At The Last Gate. It came to be that I accompanied  this young man on his journey and helped him accept that change. I knew how. Though I did not know how I knew. Then, when he was to move beyond the place I could go, I was suddenly thrown eons back, only to watch him pass through the Gate Of No Return. With shining eyes, I learned of the equivalence between life and death; a kind of recognition of continuity which touches the core of our earthly concern.
<br><br><strong>THE MIND OF THE MEDIUM: A PARADIGM SHIFT<strong><br>
One day when I was four, I saw my uncle marrying; his brother studying; our friends travelling. Chattering all this to my mother, she looked frightened.
Months and years later, it all came true. I thought I was talking about the 'present'. My grandmother read tea leaves, but I was always impatient
with ritual and the supernatural, I had to go straight tot he core of things to learn how they worked and why. Later, I asked myself: 'In the absence of angels, <strong>How do I</strong> know the things I know!?' Travelling through BA Philosophy, MA Theology provided no definitive answers, so I observed, analyzed and systematized my own, and other mediums', processes. The fruit of that decade long journey is my forthcoming book: The Mind Of The Medium.
<br>'I had discovered the rational ground of mediumship. And watched it working naturally through my own consciousness. I saw that the nature of reality determines how we know it. Or, Metaphysics determines Epistemology.
<br> To move beyond supernaturalism, we had to give up the notion that the universe is dual. That the 'spiritual' world is superior and stands over against the 'material'world as creator to created. We had finally to notice
the Plotinian Oneness we live in. The Infinite Continuity. The Hindu Brahman
of Shankara. The Unity of secular thinkers today. The Formlessness of all seers and philosophers through the ages.
<br> The Methodology details how we detach ourselves from our own ego-limitations, and from the client's, and enter the other to access their whole life in-depth, in detail and with sublime clarity. I name the easy Three-Step Process: The Trinity Of Practice. For, precognition, clairvoyance, telepathy, other-dimensional travel, diagnosis, healing are natural to our consciousness. To every one's consciousness. It is part of who we are and how we have survived these millenia. In the Oneness, all information is accessible to the person who knows how to look in just the right way. Detachment, Alignment, and Symbol Interpretation are the key. Meditative technique enables us to access any information we seek. Supernaturalism disempowered us by teachin that mediums  were the 'passive vehicles' of all manner of external agents, eg., spirits, ghosts, gods, devils and your aunt Harry. Being thus determined by these forces, our free will vanished and we could take no responsibility for what we accessed or for what we told clients. I suggest in that case, both medium and client receive limited information at best, and may be at risk at worst. Thus, moving beyond supernaturalism, we safely fashion our lives after our own yearning.  Be empowered.

 Mediumship is about tapping into the client's energy field and accessing all their information. By mirroring the client, the medium walks in their shoes and experiences their past, present, future 'as if' s/he were them. Meditation is the key to mirroring.
<br><br><br><br>
Once we looked at the plant and it taught us how to heal ourselves. We looked at the animal and it showed us where to find water. We looked at each other and saw ourselves reflected in their eyes. The medium enters this Cosmic Conversation and speaks of the past and future, the deep and the high.
<br><br>
My work is the first naturalistic study of mediumship and mystical experience by a professional medium. It details the medium's method which includes The Trinity Of Practice, the 3-point method, by which all information is accessed from any part of the universe via Detachment, Alignment, Symbol Interpretation. We stand at the center of the Interconnected Universe, looking into the Past at our left, the Present straight ahead and the Future to our right. From the centerpoint, everything is known.
